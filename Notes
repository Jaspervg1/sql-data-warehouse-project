Questions that you can ask to understand the source. This in order to extract the correct data.

Business Context & Ownership
- Who owns the data?
- What Business Process it supports? (customer transactions, supply chain logistics or finance reporting?)
  You can understand the importance of your data
- System & Data documentation?
- Data Model from the source system & Data catalog. Like descriptions of the columns and the tables. For example joining tables together.

Architecture & Technology Stack
- How is the data stored? (on prem: Sql Server, Oracle, Cloud: AWS, Azure, Snowflake..)
- What are the integration capabilities? How am I going to get the data? (API, Kafka, file extraction, Direct DB.)

Extract & Load
- Incremental vs Full Loads?
- Data Scope & Historical needs. Do we need all data? 10 years of data. Are the histories already in the source system, or do we build it in the data warehouse.
- Expected size of the extracts? MB, GB, TB?
- Are there any data volume limitations? Perfomance of that source system.
